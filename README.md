# GitLet
A Git-style VCS implemented using Java

Introduction:

This summer I had come to UC Berkeley as a visiting scholar. Having heard of CS61B's reputation, I 
decided to attend this infamous class (despite having taken CS225 already at UIUC). This repo contains
my implementation of the 2nd project we had to make in CS61B - GitLet, a Java based Git-esque VCS. I will 
finish updating the README over the next few days with description of the MVC based design I had utilized
to allow for modular and efficent development of the system.
